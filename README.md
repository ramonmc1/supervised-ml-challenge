# supervised-ml-challenge

Data included: 

 - 2019loans.csv
 - 2020Q1loans.csv
 
Data Preparation:

The GenerateData Jupyter file was run again to generate the 2019loans.csv and the 2020Q1loans. These new files contain the column 'target' vs 'loan status' included in the original csv files. Also, the new files remove duplicate index columns. The starter code was adjusted to reflect these changes.

Analysis:

Analysis was included in the jupyter notebook as markdown text.
